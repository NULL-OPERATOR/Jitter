## Jitter

a java twitter example, using the console

First crack at a Java project, pretty damn fun, still lots to learn, and a lot of areas to redo, and
a vast many more tests that should have been written/need fixing. Although I did TDD to begin with, I kept playing/tweaking/changing dramatically things as I learnt more.

#### To run

clone the project from gitHub
```
$ git clone https://github.com/NULL-OPERATOR/Jitter

cd into here
```

```

then enter this to run the console app
```
$ java JitterConsole
```
#### Tech

 - Java / JUnit

I also researched Mockito, PostGresSQL, and Hibernate, however have not implemented them as of yet.
